logic-word-search
=================

This project is a demonstration of some `core.logic` ideas in `clojure`.

It is commented and designed to be easily understood by a beginner to `core.logic.`

It contains a single `clojure` file which contains a simple implementation for a "Word Search" type program.

Since the program is written in logic programming, the program for finding words in a grid is the same as the program
which can populate words into a grid.

This implementation does not support reverse or diagonal words, just left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
